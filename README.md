PandarenCore
============

Port TrinityCore 4.3.4 to Mist of Pandaria 5.0.5.16135.
A lot of work is based on Fabi's work (https://github.com/Arctium/Arctium) so big up to him ! Thank you !
Big thank you for TrinityCore community and dev and all people who worked in this project.

This is basically a playground about MoP emulation.

I'm not an amazing dev, by far. So don't hesitate to correct me if I do wrong things...
I'll be glad if people want to work a bit on it and it would be nice to share knowledge.

TrinityCore is a MMORPG Framework based mostly on C++. It is completely 
open source, and is community supported. It is derived
from MaNGOS, the Massive Network Game Object Server, and is based on the
code of that project with extensive changes over time to optimize, improve
and cleanup the codebase at the same time as improving the ingame mechanics
and functionality. If you wish to contribute ideas or code please visit
